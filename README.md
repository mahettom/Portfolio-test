# Three.js-Training

Tech : **React Tailwind Three.js** 

### Description

I choose to do a portfolio after Ironhack for keep experimenting react and discover new techniques like Tailwind and three.js

### Error

- I should adopt the mobile first design since the start. it make me loose a treamendous amount of time.
- I take exmeple from Javascript Mastery on youtube for getting introduce to this two new technologies. I finish his exemple first and then delete almost everything because i needed to do it myself for learning. I found the documentation from tailwind reaaly clear and i dont think i needed to loose time watching a exemple just for that.

### Benefit

- In the other hand he show me a different way to start a project and build the constant file where he store his information. I kept that approach when I start again to customize the project
- So I think this errors was constructive, it show me why this good practice exist and if I try to gain time at the begining of the project i will surely regret it after.

## Possible Improvement

- Each section of the application was well divided in component but inside of these sections I could become more consistant creating more sub-component.
- I could go over all the code I did to find repetition or inconsistency, but I will focus now on other things.
